\value{
A list containing the web package details including:
\itemize{
\item id - Web package ID
\item type - Package type (determined after processing)

\description{
Creates a web package in Skilljar by providing a URL to a remotely hosted ZIP file.
The ZIP file can contain HTML5 content, SCORM packages, or other web-based learning content.
Skilljar will download and re-host the content.
}
\details{
\strong{Asynchronous Processing:} Web packages are processed asynchronously by Skilljar.
The package type is determined after processing the ZIP file.
Supported types include SCORM packages and HTML5 content.

If you create a lesson immediately after creating a web package, it may fail if
processing hasn't completed. Consider using \code{get_web_package()} to check the
processing state before creating lessons, or implement retry logic.

The content_url must be publicly accessible for Skilljar to download.
Consider using a temporary signed URL from a cloud storage service if needed.
